Repository for student collaboration


This is a repository to illustrate how the students may collaborate through github. Github is an online tool for development collaboration. It provides method for students to share documents, source code, and organizing/storing them. Github also allows the students to work on the same source code simaltaneously and helps to merge the changes from multiple edits. Github promotes collaboration by providing the following:

## Shared storage
All students in the same class may view the same repository. They are also able to add files, edit files, and delete files. 

## Shared usage
Students may be able to clone the repository locally and make edits/changes, and then commit to the master branch. If the students made changes to the same file, Github also provides help to merge the changes students made in their local computer into the master branch on Github.

## Promote planning and collaboration
When students are working on group project, they will meet and discuss about the best Github project structure so that the tasks can be divided and the repository structure reflects and enforces that the planning.

## Promote communication
Github provides many ways for collaborators to communicate with each other:
* A __markdown__ file (the file you are reading) is a great way to document the best practices, limitation, and usage of projects
* __Issues__ tab allows students to submit and track the issues in projects 
* __Wiki__ tab allows the students to document the information, research results, and createing complicated multi-page website for the project

## Tracking
Github tracks all commits into the repository so it's very easy for instructor and students to see who did what and when.
